## TicketBeast!

This repository contains the source code for each Test-Driven Laravel lesson that has been published so far.

Each lesson that includes code changes has its own commit so you can see the diff for that lesson.

There's a few extra commits for steps that happen behind the scenes, so if you are following along, be sure to check for those steps if you ever notice your code is out of sync with what's happening in the lessons.
